# DesignPatterns

## 1) Singleton Pattern 

### Implementation Details
The Singleton pattern is implemented in this project to ensure that only one instance of the `Singleton` class exists throughout the application's lifecycle. This is achieved by:
- **Private Constructor:** Prevents the direct construction of the object from outside the class.
- **Thread-Safe Instance Creation:** Utilizes double-checked locking to ensure that only one instance is created even in multi-threaded environments. The `_instance` is first checked to be null before locking the object for instantiation.

### Pros and Cons

| Pros | Cons |
| ---- | ---- |
| Ensures a class only has one instance, providing a global point of access. | Can introduce global state in an application, which might lead to unpredictable behaviors if not managed carefully. |
| Lazily loaded and thread-safe, making it efficient in a multithreaded environment. | Difficult to unit test due to the global state and the static nature of the singleton. |
| Reduces the overhead of creating multiple instances if only one instance is required throughout the application. | May lead to scalability issues as the application grows, especially if used inappropriately. |

### Beneficial Use Cases
- **Application Configuration:** Useful for classes that handle application configuration settings, ensuring that configuration data is centralized and consistently used throughout the application.
- **Database Connection Pools:** Ideal for managing a database connection pool where multiple instances are unnecessary and might be resource-intensive.
- **Logging:** Effective for implementing loggers as a single instance can efficiently manage log files without the overhead of multiple instances writing to the same file.
- **Hardware Interface Access:** Suitable for managing access to hardware interfaces like printers or file systems, where single access point is desired.

## 2) Factory Pattern 

### Implementation Overview
The Factory Pattern is implemented in this project to demonstrate an effective way of creating objects while hiding the creation logic from the client. In this pattern, an interface is used for creating an object, but the choice of the class to instantiate is deferred to subclasses. This is achieved by:
- **Product Interface:** An `IProduct` interface defines the operations that all concrete products must implement.
- **Concrete Products:** Classes like `ConcreteProductA` and `ConcreteProductB` implement the `IProduct` interface, providing specific behaviors.
- **Creator Class:** An abstract `Creator` class declares the factory method (`FactoryMethod`) that returns an object of type `IProduct`.
- **Concrete Creators:** Subclasses of `Creator` (`ConcreteCreatorA` and `ConcreteCreatorB`) override the factory method to instantiate and return specific products.

### Pros and Cons

| Pros | Cons |
| ---- | ---- |
| Promotes loose coupling by not requiring the client to specify exact classes to instantiate. | Can complicate the code structure by introducing multiple additional classes. |
| Supports easy introduction of new product types without changing existing code. | Requires more initial setup and understanding of the pattern's structure. |
| Enhances scalability and maintainability by centralizing object creation. | May lead to overuse in simple scenarios, where a factory is unnecessary. |

### Beneficial Use Cases
- **Dynamic Object Creation:** Useful in scenarios where the type of object to create can vary based on context or configuration.
- **System Configuration:** Ideal for managing creation of objects that differ based on different environments or system settings.
- **Plugin and Extension Systems:** Enables easier management and integration of new plugins or extensions without modifying the core application code.
- **UI Libraries:** In GUI development, to create different types of elements (like buttons, windows, etc.) based on user actions or application state.

# DesignPatterns

## Singleton Pattern 

### Implementation Details
The Singleton pattern is implemented in this project to ensure that only one instance of the `Singleton` class exists throughout the application's lifecycle. This is achieved by:
- **Private Constructor:** Prevents the direct construction of the object from outside the class.
- **Thread-Safe Instance Creation:** Utilizes double-checked locking to ensure that only one instance is created even in multi-threaded environments. The `_instance` is first checked to be null before locking the object for instantiation.

### Pros and Cons

| Pros | Cons |
| ---- | ---- |
| Ensures a class only has one instance, providing a global point of access. | Can introduce global state in an application, which might lead to unpredictable behaviors if not managed carefully. |
| Lazily loaded and thread-safe, making it efficient in a multithreaded environment. | Difficult to unit test due to the global state and the static nature of the singleton. |
| Reduces the overhead of creating multiple instances if only one instance is required throughout the application. | May lead to scalability issues as the application grows, especially if used inappropriately. |

### Beneficial Use Cases
- **Application Configuration:** Useful for classes that handle application configuration settings, ensuring that configuration data is centralized and consistently used throughout the application.
- **Database Connection Pools:** Ideal for managing a database connection pool where multiple instances are unnecessary and might be resource-intensive.
- **Logging:** Effective for implementing loggers as a single instance can efficiently manage log files without the overhead of multiple instances writing to the same file.
- **Hardware Interface Access:** Suitable for managing access to hardware interfaces like printers or file systems, where single access point is desired.
